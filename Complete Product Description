## Project Overview
This project simulates a retail sales dataset and demonstrates SQL querying skills.  
It includes tables for *customers, products, and orders, sample data, and **20 SQL queries* covering basic queries, joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions.

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice SQL querying and data manipulation
- Generate business insights from a small dataset
- Create a GitHub portfolio-ready project

## How to Use

1. *Create Tables*  
   Run schema.sql to create the tables in your SQL database.

2. *Insert Data*  
   Run data.sql to populate tables with sample data.

3. *Run Queries*  
   Open queries.sql to see 20 queries with descriptions.  
   Queries cover:
   - Basic SELECT and filtering
   - JOINs
